# OSINT-Methodology-An-Overview-of-Open-Source-Intelligence-Research
Applies structured open-source intelligence (OSINT) methodology to analyse publicly available information, with an emphasis on legality, transparency, and reproducible research.

# OSINT Methodology

## What this is
This repository documents a practical, structured approach to open-source intelligence (OSINT) research.
It focuses on using publicly available information to answer specific questions, assess risk, or understand relationships between entities, while maintaining clear documentation of sources, assumptions, and uncertainty.
The emphasis is on process rather than tools — how to think about OSINT work, how to scope it, and how to avoid common analytical errors when working with large volumes of open data.

## What this is not
This is not:

Hacking, intrusion, or unauthorised access to systems

Social engineering, impersonation, or deception

Scraping private or paywalled data

Surveillance of individuals for harassment or doxxing

OSINT work operates within the limits of what is publicly observable. Absence of evidence, outdated data, and deliberate obfuscation are expected constraints, not failures.

## Methodology overview
The methodology outlined here follows a deliberately conservative research flow:
Question definition – clearly state what is being investigated and why
Scope & constraints – define time bounds, jurisdictions, and data types
Source identification – prioritise primary and verifiable public sources
Collection – gather data with minimal transformation
Correlation & validation – cross-check claims against independent sources
Analysis – interpret findings while separating fact from inference
Documentation – record sources, assumptions, and confidence levels
Review – identify gaps, contradictions, and unresolved questions

## Example workflows
Example workflows in this repository may include:
Mapping relationships between domains, infrastructure, or organisations
Identifying shared assets or patterns across publicly visible systems
Establishing timelines from archived web content and public records
Assessing credibility of claims using corroborating sources

These examples are illustrative rather than exhaustive, and are designed to show how questions are approached rather than to provide turnkey answers.

## Ethical & legal boundaries
All work described here assumes:
Compliance with applicable laws and regulations
Respect for privacy and proportionality
Avoidance of harm, harassment, or misuse
Transparency about uncertainty and limitations

Ethical OSINT work requires restraint. The fact that information is technically accessible does not automatically make its use appropriate in every context.

## Limitations and uncertainty
OSINT findings are inherently incomplete.
Public data can be outdated, inaccurate, intentionally misleading, or context-dependent. Analytical conclusions should therefore be framed in terms of likelihoods and confidence levels, not absolute claims.
Where conclusions rely on inference, this is explicitly stated. Where data is missing or contradictory, this is treated as a finding in itself.

## Who this is for
Who this is for. This repository may be useful for:

Researchers and analysts working with public data
Due-diligence, compliance, or risk-assessment professionals
Journalists and investigators interested in methodological rigour
Developers and data practitioners entering OSINT-adjacent work
